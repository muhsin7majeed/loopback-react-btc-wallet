# React-Loopback-Wallet-App

demo : https://loopback-react-btc-wallet.herokuapp.com/

I made this app for learning react and loopback. I used React, Loopback, bootstrap.

Features : Authentication (create account and login, form validation seems to work fine) Add money (fake money obviously :p) Send money to other users with their "wallet address"

Features I would like to add; Notification when received money Message when sending money Add user image on sign in Edit user details ...


The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
